        <p><code>Neurevolve</code> simulates the evolution of organisms in a 
            resource limited world. The behaviour of each organism is driven by 
            a simple neural network.</p>

        <h1>Network</h1>
        <p>The <a href="neurevolve/network/Network.html">neural networks</a> in Neurevolve 
            are very simple. They consist of a
            single ordered list of <a href="neurevolve/network/Neuron.html">neurons</a>. When a
        network is activated, it activates each neuron in the list in turn.</p> 
            
            <p>Each
            neuron contains:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A threshold.</li>
            <li>Zero or more inputs from the world.</li>
            <li>Zero or more weighted links to neurons earlier in the network.</li>
            <li>Zero or one activities that might be performed in the world.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When a neuron is activated</p>
